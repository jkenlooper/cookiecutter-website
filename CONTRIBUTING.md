# Guide on Contributing

Thanks for your interest in cookiecutter-website!  I've mostly updated this
project with bits and pieces from other websites that I've made and maintain.
I'm open for any ideas, suggestions, new features, or other improvements to the
project.

There is also this helpful guide on
[How to contribute to an open source project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Bug Reports and New Features

Please contact me if you have found a bug or want to add a new feature.  There
are probably a lot of things here that are not immediately obvious.  At this
point, not many developers have used this to my knowledge.  I'm usually pretty
available to help with questions you may have.
